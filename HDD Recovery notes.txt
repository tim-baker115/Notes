Things to look out for

Below is a list of things to look out for which are typical of a failing hard disk:

    System instability (especially on systems with a single hard drive).
    Partitions forcefully unmounted.
    Disk noise and clicking (implicit of a physical failure).
    Data lost.
    Errors in fsck/xfs_repair.
    Errors in dmesg/syslog identifying the disk as faulty.
    SMART errors if disk scans are carried out via cron (errors will be in the log but will contain more detail then a forced umount). 

[edit] Identify exactly which disk/partition is at fault

Identify if the disk has bad blocks, this will fundamentally demonstrate a fault (this step may not be needed if the disk fails to mount for example).

   badblocks -vn /dev/<partition or disk>

Make a note of any disk labels (these will be used at a later point):

   lsblk -o name,mountpoint,label,size,uuid

[edit] Cautious Duplication

    Run a live tool which has disk recovery tools present (such as SystemResuce disk) on it (such as ddrescue).
    Do not mount any partitions
    Run the following command, setting the source (sdx in this example) and destination (sdy in this example) where appropriate. 

   ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/sdx /dev/sdy

[edit] Duplication

    Unmount any disks you wish to duplicate (umount /dev/sdx), if the root partition is on this disk then get into single user mode.
    Run the following command, setting the source (sdx in this example) and destination (sdy in this example) where appropriate. 

   dd if=/dev/sdx of=/dev/sdy

[edit] Backing up a disk layout

sfdisk is a tool which can read the partition layout of a disk and either back it up to a text file or copy it to a new disk, it can be useful if there are concerns about the partition table or if a disk is to be replaced which is bigger/smaller than the original disk.
[edit] Copy partition table to new disk

   sfdisk -d /dev/sdx | sfdisk /dev/sdy

[edit] Copy a partition table to a text file

   sfdisk -d /dev/sdx > /partition.table

[edit] Restore a partition table from a text file

   sfdisk /dev/sdx < /partition.table
